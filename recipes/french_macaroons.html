        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 egg whites</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons superfine (castor) sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup almond meal</li>
            <li>1â…“ cups confectioners' sugar</li>

        <ol>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone mat.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg whites in a clean metal mixing bowl until thick, about 5 minutes.
                 Whisk superfine sugar into egg whites until thick, glossy, and stiff peaks form, 5 to 8 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Sift almond meal and confectioners' sugar over beaten egg whites; gently fold in, retaining as much air as possible.</li>
            <li>Divide meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color, if desired.</li>
            <li>Spoon meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 3/8-inch tip.
                 Pipe 1-inch disks of meringue onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies.</li>
            <li>Let cookies stand at room temperature to form a thin skin, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lift the baking sheets; let drop from several inches above the work surface to adhere cookies to the baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry,
                 about 15 minutes; let cool completely on the baking sheets before peeling off the parchment paper, about 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
